# Wilbertpol Test Suite

This repository contains only [Wilbert Pol's tests](https://github.com/wilbertpol/mooneye-gb/) (the duplicated test with `mooneye-test-suite` were removed). This fork is based on https://github.com/Amjad50/mooneye-gb/ which includes a magic breakpoint `ld b,b` at the end of each test.

The tests can be downloaded from [here](https://nightly.link/vojty/wilbertpol-test-suite/workflows/ci/main/tests.zip)
